## Why we started Journalism Society

The purpose of the Journalism Club is to foster an informed and engaged student community by producing high-quality written work and hosting meaningful public discussions. The club will hold regular forums on local politics, social issues, and cultural trends, giving students a structured space to analyze current events with clarity, fairness, and critical thinking.
Members will also contribute to a weekly publication featuring two articles: one unbiased, research-based report on current events, and one opinion piece examining topics in pop culture, society and politics.
In addition to writing and discussion, the club is committed to strengthening its connection to the broader community through service. We will organize volunteer initiatives, such as a club beach clean-up day, to promote civic responsibility and demonstrate the club's dedication to public engagement beyond the page.
